# Get Started

The Smart Parking application uses AI-driven video analytics to optimize parking management. It provides a modular architecture that integrates seamlessly with various input sources and leverages AI models to deliver accurate and actionable insights.

By following this guide, you will learn how to:
- **Set up the sample application**: Use Docker Compose to quickly deploy the application in your environment.
- **Run a predefined pipeline**: Execute a pipeline to see smart parking application in action.

## Prerequisites
- Verify that your system meets the [minimum requirements](./system-requirements.md).
- Install Docker: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

<!--
**Setup and First Use**: Include installation instructions, basic operation, and initial validation.
-->
## Set up and First Use

<!--
**User Story 1**: Setting Up the Application  
- **As a developer**, I want to set up the application in my environment, so that I can start exploring its functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Step-by-step instructions for downloading and installing the application.
2. Verification steps to ensure successful setup.
3. Troubleshooting tips for common installation issues.
-->

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
     cd edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/metro-vision-ai-app-recipe/
     ```

2. **Setup Application and Download Assets**:
   - Use the installation script to configure the application and download required models:
     ```bash
     ./install.sh smart-parking
     ```

## Run the Application

1. **Start the Application**:
   - Download container images with Application microservices and run with Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker compose up -d
     ```
     
     <details>
     <summary>
     Check Status of Microservices
     </summary>
     
     - The application starts the following microservices.
     - To check if all microservices are in Running state:
       ```bash
       docker ps
       ```
       
     **Expected Services:**
     - Grafana Dashboard
     - DL Streamer Pipeline Server  
     - MQTT Broker
     - Node-RED (for applications without Scenescape)
     - Scenescape services (for Smart Intersection only)
     
     </details>

2. **Run Predefined Pipelines**:
   - Pipeline startup depends on your application type:
   
   - Start video streams to run video inference pipelines:
     ```bash
     ./sample_start.sh
     ```
     
     <details>
     <summary>
     Check Status and Stop pipelines
     </summary>
     
     - To check the status:
       ```bash
       ./sample_status.sh
       ```
     
     - To stop the pipelines without waiting for video streams to finish replay:
       ```bash
       ./sample_stop.sh
       ```
     </details>

3. **View the Application Output**:
   - Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Grafana dashboard.
     - Change the localhost to your host IP if you are accessing it remotely.
   - Log in with the following credentials:
     - **Username**: `admin`
     - **Password**: `admin`
   - Check under the Dashboards section for the application-specific preloaded dashboard.
   - **Expected Results**: The dashboard displays real-time video streams with AI overlays and detection metrics.

4. **Stop the Application**:
   - To stop the application microservices, use the following command:
     ```bash
     docker compose down
     ```

### How to Use Applications

- [Smart Parking](./how-to-use-application.md)

## Troubleshooting

1. **Changing the Host IP Address**

   - If you need to use a specific Host IP address instead of the one automatically detected during installation, you can explicitly provide it using the following command:

     ```bash
     ./install.sh <application-name> <HOST_IP>
     ```
     
     Example:
     ```bash
     ./install.sh smart-parking 192.168.1.100
     ```

2. **Containers Not Starting**:
   - Check the Docker logs for errors:
     ```bash
     docker ps -a
     docker logs <CONTAINER_ID>
     ```

3. **Failed Service Deployment**:
   - If unable to deploy services successfully due to proxy issues, ensure the proxy is configured in the `~/.docker/config.json`:

     ```json
     {
       "proxies": {
         "default": {
           "httpProxy": "http://your-proxy:port",
           "httpsProxy": "https://your-proxy:port",
           "noProxy": "localhost,127.0.0.1"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

   - After editing the file, restart docker:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     sudo systemctl restart docker
     ```
