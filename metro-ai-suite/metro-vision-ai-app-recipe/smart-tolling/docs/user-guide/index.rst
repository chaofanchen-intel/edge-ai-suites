Smart Tolling
============================================

The Smart Tolling application uses AI-driven video analytics to detect vehicles and recognize license plates across multiple lanes. It identifies vehicles in real-time and extracts license plate information with high accuracy, providing essential data for tolling systems.

This solution processes video streams from tolling points and uses deep learning models to detect vehicles and read license plates. The application monitors traffic flow across multiple lanes simultaneously and publishes this data for visualization and integration with other systems.

By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and pre-trained deep learning models, this application enables real-time processing and analysis of video streams from tolling points. Built on a modular architecture, it provides a foundation that can be extended to implement complete tolling solutions including vehicle classification and reporting.
